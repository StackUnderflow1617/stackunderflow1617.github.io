# Who am I? / About
As my description says, I am a somebody that does somebody-like things, the end... not really. I am a somewhat coder that knows how to do basic javascript and other stuff like that. Besides coding and doing stuff on github, I am also an active user on reddit and somewhat active uploader on youtube, my videos mainly being about Minecraft.

On my reddit page, I like to show off my Pokemon and Minecraft stuff but sometimes I post experiment stuff like upscaling One Piece pictures or upscaling images in general using Topaz AI and such.

Basically I do stuff, so like yeah... that's me... thats my Ted Talk #1.
